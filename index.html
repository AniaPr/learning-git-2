			<h1>Kings Of Leon - Pyro</h1>
			<p>
				Single book of matches<br />
				Gonna burn what's standing in the way<br />
				Rolling down the mountain<br />
				Now they're calling on the fire brigade<br />
				Bury all the pictures and tell the kids that I'm ok<br />
				Even I'm forgotten<br />
				They'll remember me for today
			</p>
			<p>
				I won't ever be your corner stone<br />
				I...<br />
				All the black inside me<br />
				Is slowly seeping from the bone<br />
				Everything I cherish<br />
				Is slowly dying or it's gone<br />
				Little shaken babies<br />
				And drunkards seem to all agree<br />
				Once the show gets started<br />
				It's bound to be a sight to see<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				I won't ever be your corner stone<br />
				I don't wanna be her holding on<br />
				I won't ever be your corner stone<br />
				I...<br />
				Watch her roar<br />
				Can you feel it?<br />
				Watch her roar<br />
				Can you feel it?<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				Watch her roar<br />
				Can you feel it?<br />
				Watch her roar<br />
				Can you feel it?<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				I won't ever be your corner stone<br />
				I don't wanna be her holding on<br />
				I won't ever be your corner stone<br />
